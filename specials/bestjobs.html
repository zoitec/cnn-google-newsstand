            Whether you're Snapchatting with friends or catching Pok√©mon, you probably spend time every day using the creations of mobile app developers. They aren't necessarily saving the world, but mobile app developers get to create something that can reach millions of people on a daily basis.
    </p>
        <p>That means growing demand for developers who build and update apps so they're secure, user-friendly, and sought after.</p>


    <p>
        <strong>Why it's great</strong><br>Mobile app developers are the first to test out the latest phones, tablets, and wearable devices. "If you like playing around with technology and exploring all the possibilities it offers, this can be a really fun job," says mobile app developer Kyle Craig.

    <hr class="style-id:relatedContentDivider"><p class="style-id:caption"><span class="style-id:caption">Julie Pemberton, vice president, risk management at Diatom Ventures</span></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Risk Management Director</strong><br>Median Pay: $131,000
        <br>Top Pay: $200,000
        <br>10-year job growth: 7%
    </p>
    <p>
        When a hurricane knocks out a warehouse or a distribution center, the risk management director jumps into action, directing cleanup and rebuilding efforts and filing the necessary insurance claims.
    </p>
        The job has evolved in recent years to be about more than just natural disasters. Directors are now also tasked with identifying, preventing, and planning for all the risks a company might face, from cybersecurity breaches to a stock market collapse.
    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Why it's great</strong><br>As they uncover new risks, risk management directors must also advise the company on how to address them. "That keeps me totally engaged and gives me the ability to be creative and find solutions for the business," says risk management vice president Julie Pemberton. "I'm constantly contributing to the business in a meaningful way."

    <hr class="style-id:relatedContentDivider"><p class="style-id:caption"><span class="style-id:caption">Jance Floyd, project land manager and lawyer for Purple Land Management</span></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mobile App Developer</strong><br>Median Pay: $97,100

        Imagine knocking on someone's door and offering them a brand new stream of income that will last decades into the future. That's one of the perks of the job for landmen, who serve as a liaison between energy companies, people who own mineral rights to the properties the companies would like to access, and government agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Landmen research the titles of the properties and negotiate deals with landowners. When oil prices are down, they also spend a lot of time working on acquisition and divestiture work, helping energy companies sell and buy properties and rights from each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Why it's great</strong><br>There's a feeling of patriotism among landmen, who consider themselves on the frontline as America moves toward energy independence. "There's a sense of pride that a lot of people don't get in their job on a day-to-day basis," says landman Jance Floyd.
